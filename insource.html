        <p class="bullet">Recapture and Revitalize your Talent Brand with our RPI Offering</p>
        <p>
                The trend toward recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) has succeeded in masking truth of the talent acquisition processes by leveraging the inherent weaknesses of traditional talent acquisition metrics. The damage you may be doing to your talent brand and the long-term damage to your cultural sustainment or transformation efforts could be catastrophic.

                When evaluating your talent strategy what are your desired outcomes?
        </h1>
        <p>Cost Savings<br>Speed<br>Compliance<br>Quality</p>
<h1 class="text">This viewpoint sets-up the classic and unnecessary conflict between:
    </h1 class="text">
    <p>Human Resources vs Procurement vs Operations</p>
    <h1 class="text">Break out of this thinking model.</h1>
    <p class="bullet">Has it reduced Third Party Spend?  No!</p>
    <p>RPO merely consolidates the same or often greater total spend under the RPO provider, a handful special vendors, and The BIG BOYS when it comes to executive and board member hire.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet">
                Has it increased speed of hire?  No! 
        </p>
        <p>The RPO process merely consolidates the limited sources of inputs (resumes).  Therefore, the quality of the inputs hasn’t increased nor has the screen through which the inputs are sorted.  Moreover, the hiring process, now being administered by an outsourced supplier, hasn’t changed at all.  How could this possibly increase the speed of hire?  And is speed really what you are after?
            </p>
            <p class="bullet">
                    Has it increased compliance or enhanced corporate culture? Maybe?
            </p>
            <p>RPO, in reality, has merely matrixed the responsibility of compliance to the RPO provider.  RPO has merely outsourced compliance to an auditable line-item on the invoice remitted from the RPO provider.</p>
            <p class="bullet">
                    Has it increased the quality of your hires?
            </p>
            <p>Here is where the rubber really meets the road.  Were your hires poor before the choice to move to RPO? Are they better now?  Based on what criteria?</p>
            <h1 class="text">Don't expect tactics to solve a strategic problem.</h1>
            <p >Does the CEO feel acquiring and retaining talent is a problem?</p>
            <p >Who is accountable to solve this problem?</p>
            <p>Does the solution have a budget fitting the size of the problem?</p>
